# Core Actions & Turn Sequence

## Core Actions
Each unit can perform one of three actions on a turn:

### Attack
- Use unit's power as damage
- Must defeat bottom row before higher rows
- Unit goes to discard after attacking

### Defend
- Place unit in a defense row
- Must fill rows from bottom up
- Unit's power becomes its defense value
- Stays in defense until defeated

### Recruit
- Convert unit's power to authority
- Use authority to buy market cards
- Recruited units go to discard pile
- Authority must be spent the same turn

## Basic Turn Sequence

1. Start Phase
   - Resolve start-of-turn effects
   - Check defending unit abilities
2. Command Phase
   - Use units for attack/defend/recruit
   - Resolve abilities as they trigger
3. Draw Phase
   - Discard unused cards
   - Draw up to 4 cards
4. Market Phase
   - Fill empty market slots
   - Allow market swap if eligible

## Tips for New Players

- Early Game Defense: place Squires and Men-at-arms in defense early
- Unit Management: target weak opponent units early, maintain defense in late game
