# Authority - Card Battle Game

## Introduction
Authority is a strategic card game where players take the role of monarchs commanding powerful factions in a battle for supremacy. Through careful resource management, tactical unit placement, and strategic card play, players aim to defeat their rivals while protecting their own realm.

### Core Concepts
1. **Resource Management**

   - Authority: Generated by units to recruit new forces
   - Cards: Hand management and deck building

2. **Combat System**
   - Three-tiered defense structure
   - Individual unit actions
   - Strategic unit placement

3. **Factions**
   - Royal Soldiers: Balanced and reliable forces
   - Bloodrunners: Aggressive, fast-paced tactics
   - Iron Wall: Defensive fortification specialists
   - House of Golden Ox: Economic and recruitment experts
   - Hooded Brothers: Evasion and disruption specialists

### Game Overview
- 2-4 players
- 30-45 minutes playing time
- Ages 12+
- Players start at 40 HP
- Last monarch standing wins

## Basic Game Rules

### Game Setup
1. **Board Setup**
   - Place market deck in center
   - Create space for 6 face-up market cards
   - Each player creates their play area with:
     - Defense rows (0-3)
     - Draw/discard piles
     - General zone
     - Hand area

2. **Starting State**
   - Each player starts with 40 HP
   - Shuffle 8-card starting deck
   - Place Kingsguard in Row 0
   - First player draws 3 cards
   - Other players draw 4 cards

### Core Actions
Each unit can perform ONE of three actions:

1. **Attack**
   - Use unit's power as damage
   - Must defeat bottom row before higher rows
   - Unit goes to discard after attacking

2. **Defend**
   - Place unit in defense row
   - Must fill rows from bottom up
   - Unit's power becomes defense value
   - Stays in defense until defeated

3. **Recruit**
   - Convert unit's power to authority
   - Use authority to buy market cards
   - Recruited units go to discard pile
   - Must spend all authority same turn

### Basic Turn Sequence
1. Start Phase
   - Resolve start-of-turn effects
   - Check defending unit abilities
2. Command Phase
   - Use units for attack/defend/recruit
   - Resolve abilities as they trigger
3. Draw Phase
   - Discard unused cards
   - Draw up to 4 cards
4. Market Phase
   - Fill empty market slots
   - Allow market swap if eligible

### Tips for New Players
1. **Early Game Defense**
   - Place Squires and Men-at-arms in defense early
   - This improves future hand quality
   - Consider losing Kingsguard to add to deck

2. **Unit Management**
   - Target opponent's weak units early
   - Recruit units above your deck's power average
   - Maintain defense in late game
   - Watch for sudden damage combinations

### Special Unit Types
1. **Spies**
   - Can only recruit or enter general zone
   - Can remove enemy spies when discarded
   - Special interaction with general zone

2. **Leaders**
   - No power value for actions
   - Enter general zone immediately when recruited
   - Cannot be removed once placed
   - Always active abilities

3. **Superpower Units**
   - Cannot generate authority
   - Special combat abilities
   - Unique tactical options

### Value Multipliers
- "X" equals defense row number (1-3)
- "2X" doubles the row number
- Examples:
  - Row 1: X=1, 2X=2
  - Row 2: X=2, 2X=4
  - Row 3: X=3, 2X=6

## Combat System

### Defense Structure
[VISUAL: Defense row pyramid structure with unit placement examples]
[VISUAL: Combat resolution flowchart]

1. **Defense Rows**
   - Row 0: Kingsguard (special row, one-time use)
   - Row 1: Bottom row (max 3 units)
   - Row 2: Middle row (max 2 units)
   - Row 3: Top row (max 1 unit)

2. **Defense Rules**
   - Must fill rows from bottom up
   - Cannot skip rows when placing units
   - Units stay in defense until defeated
   - Defense value equals unit's power

### Attack Resolution
[VISUAL: Step-by-step attack example with before/after states]
[VISUAL: Diagram showing valid attack paths]

1. **Basic Attack Rules**
   - Units attack individually
   - Must clear lower rows first
   - Compare attack power to defense value
   - Defeated units go to owner's discard

2. **Attack Sequence**
   - Declare attacking unit
   - "When attacking" abilities trigger automatically
   - Choose valid target
   - Resolve damage
   - Attacking unit goes to discard

3. **Special Attack Cases**
   - Some abilities bypass defense rows
   - Direct monarch damage possible with abilities
   - Cannot split single unit's damage
   - Excess damage within row is lost

### Combat Example
1. **Basic Attack**
   - Attacker: Knight (4 power)
   - Defender: Row 1 has Squire (2 power)
   - Result: Squire defeated, Knight discarded

2. **Multiple Defenders**
   - Attacker: Knight (4 power)
   - Defender: Row 1 has two Squires (2 power each)
   - Result: One Squire defeated, one remains
